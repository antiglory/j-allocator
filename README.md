# j-allocator
a very simple and basic heap allocator written in C

# obs
- because the allocator uses sbrk(), we are manipulating specifically the heap and not an isolated section, so it happens that the libc chunks can conflict with the allocator chunks. So, for example, you call `printf("%p", addr)` and it write the formatted string at the same offset as a chunk in the heap allocated by jalloc()
- same as libc allocator, the responsibility of not exceeding the bounds of the allocated chunk belongs to the programmer/you
- the stability and integrity of a allocated chunk or the heap in general is not guaranteed
